However,\n                I struggled to find incentive compatible parameter selection mechanisms. While my mechanisms did have nice properties even\n                under rational deviations, I discontinued the research to focus on other interests. I still am interested in novel\n                mechanisms for blockchain parameter selection and often think about the usefulness of learning theory and control theory\n                in maintaing the stability of these systems in the presence of rational agents.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row-content\">\n              <p className=\"description\">\n                I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I studied <a href=\"https://www.nets.upenn.edu/\">NETS</a> and completed my\n                Masters in mathematics under the advisors <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/\">Aaron Roth</a> and&nbsp;\t \n                <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/\">Michael Kearns</a> on the <b>Theoretical Foundations of Blockchain Protocols</b>.\n                The thesis blended topics from such as algebraic topology, the theory of consensus protocols, and ultimately game theory.\n                My original contribution can be found in the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06836\">Delayed Blockchain Protocols</a>,&nbsp;\n                where I adapted traditional proof of work systems with a combination of delayed rewards and fraud proofs to disincentivize\n                double-spend attacks with slashing penalties.
